run_test: test single project submission, see file for usage

all_tests: wrapper around run_test to run all tests and generate log file, ideally would be run via cron at 30 minute intervals

dashboard.py: displays logfile in html format

A cron job should also be set up to delete the log file annually so that it doesn't get too backed up. 

Note: logfile doesn't match current output.
